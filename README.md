# final-project

This project is made by Charlotte Johansson, Linus Eriksson and Josefine Engdahl

Our idea was to create an app using React Native where you can search for where to stream specific movies or series. Its main purpose is to make it easier to find where movies or series are available, for example on Netflix, HBO, or Disney+.

We have worked with React Native, React Router, styled components and two different API's. The user can create a profile made with MongoDB. 

- Search for where to stream a movie or series (for example Netflix, HBO, Disney+)
- Show search results & information about the movies
- Single movie page (including description, rating, and where to stream)
- Log in and create your own profile

If we had more time, we would add a save/like function so that logged in users can save the movies they want to watch, suggest movies based on their current searches, and suggest what streaming service they should be using when based on their interests.

We have not been able to deploy as an app but we made an web app. See it live: https://streamguide.netlify.app/
